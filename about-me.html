            Science from EPFL, Switzerland, and a Bachelors degree from University of Novi Sad, Serbia. I am also a
            teaching associate, and co-head of the Technical Sciences program at Petnica Science Center.

            My main interests are programming language design, high performance / distributed computing, and computer
            architecture; as well as networking, systems programming, and everything else that makes computers go real
            fast.
        <p>
